# Shopper
A CLI shopping simulator game in Rust

### How do you play the game?
When you start, you are prompted to insert your starting money and capacity. Starting money determines how much you can buy and capacity how much you can carry.
You can enter a shop by typing its name, then add to or remove items from your basket. Lastly you can buy the contents of your basket provided you have enough money and capacity left.

### Why?
This project serves as a fun training exercise to learn the basics of the Rust programming language. It helps me familiarize myself with Rust concepts such as:
* Ownership
* The borrow checker
* Lifetimes

### Future ideas
* Ncurses interface and graphics
* Random shop and inventory generation
* Multiple stages (days)
* Return item after you bought it
